### Database Query
Setting up Oracle SQL Developer to create and manage a project database involves several steps. Here's a detailed guide to help you through the process:

Step 1: Download and Install Oracle SQL Developer
Download Oracle SQL Developer:

Visit the Oracle SQL Developer download page.
Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Download the zip file or the installer.
Install Oracle SQL Developer:

If you downloaded the zip file, extract it to a desired location.
If you downloaded the installer, run it and follow the on-screen instructions.
Step 2: Install Oracle Database (if not already installed)
Download Oracle Database:

Visit the Oracle Database download page.
Choose the version you need and download it.
Install Oracle Database:

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Set up the necessary configurations like creating a new database, setting the password for the SYS and SYSTEM users, etc.
Step 3: Start Oracle Database
Start Oracle Services:
Ensure that the Oracle database services are running. You can check this through the Services management console on Windows or through command line tools on Linux and macOS.
Step 4: Configure Oracle SQL Developer
Open Oracle SQL Developer:

Navigate to the directory where you extracted SQL Developer and run the sqldeveloper executable.
Create a New Connection:

Click on the green + icon or navigate to File > New > Database Connection.
Fill in the connection details:
Connection Name: Choose a name for your connection.
Username: Enter your database username (e.g., SYSTEM or a user you created).
Password: Enter your database password.
Hostname: Enter localhost if the database is on your local machine, or the IP address if itâ€™s on a remote server.
Port: Default is 1521.
SID/Service Name: Enter the SID or Service Name of your database (default is usually orcl).
Test the Connection:

Click on the Test button to check if the connection details are correct. If the test is successful, click Connect.
Step 5: Create and Manage Your Project Database
Create a New Schema:

Open the connection you created.
Navigate to the SQL Worksheet by clicking on the worksheet icon.
